# 📘 About This Project

**coherenteyes** is an AI Safety–oriented misinformation detection system that integrates  
**classical machine learning**, **deep learning architectures**, and **SHAP explainability**  
to provide transparent and interpretable predictions.

Beyond achieving high accuracy, the project aims to answer critical safety questions:

- *How do different models reason about fake vs. real news?*  
- *Do models rely on meaningful patterns or dataset artifacts?*  
- *How interpretable are decisions from linear models vs. neural networks?*  
- *How robust are these models under distribution shift or adversarial variations?*  

The project demonstrates how explainable AI can be used to **audit model behavior**,  
**identify failure modes**, and **support responsible deployment** in sensitive information ecosystems.

# 🧠 AI Safety Design Principles

coherenteyes focuses on the following safety principles:

### ✔️ Transparency  
- SHAP explanations  
- Token-level interpretability  
- Attention visualization  

### ✔️ Robustness  
Evaluated across:
- Different architectures  
- Long vs. short text  
- Simple vs. complex features  

### ✔️ Failure Mode Analysis  
Identifies issues such as:
- Dataset artifacts  
- Keyword reliance  
- Overconfidence  

### ✔️ Responsible Deployment  
Warns about the risks of:
- False positives (unwanted censorship)  
- False negatives (misinformation spread)  
- Distribution shift failures
